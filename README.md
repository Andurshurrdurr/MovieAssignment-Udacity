<h1><b>Welcome,</b></h1>

This is the first assignment in the Udacity course on full stack web development by Anders Hurum.

In addition to using the freshtomatoes module I have done some additions:
- Using subclasses for Movies and TVshows
- Changed code in freshtomatoes package to add info field under title for either duration for movies or season for tvshows
- open_movies_page in freshtomatoes now takes two arguments, one for Movies and one for TVshows.

Update:
- Instantiating objects of a class now prints out when the object was instantiated
- Provided Docstrings to classes. Write *Class*.__doc__ to get more info about the class 

Yes, I did do it somehow more difficult for myself as i could just add a fifth string for the movie info with duration or season instead of using subclasses, but the point here was to practise.

To run this program:

Run "entertainment_center.py" with a python 2 interpreter.
